Hi! I'm a first year college student - currently majoring in BSCA. A little information on this website: <br>
- It was inspired by Alice in Wonderland (which is why the pages may seem random. <br> - It was made using html, css, and javascript. All coded in notepad, so I apologize if it isn't the best. <br> - All designs were made in canva, and I do not own the images. <br> - I had to scrap my original design, so this one was kind of rushed. However, I do plan to make updates here and there (when I feel like it). <br> <br>
Likes: Arts and music (or an creative activities), Psychology, Typology, philosophy, CATS, games, cold weather, and books. <br> <br>
Dislikes: (VERY) Hot weather, arrogant people, and people who don't respect your boundaries. </p>

<summary> 12.17.25 - <i> Haircut. </i> </summary>
  <p> I've been thinking about getting a new haircut. Well, the old haircut that I had 2 years ago, but I'm not so sure. I'm still thinking about it... I've been doing research again (as usual), and it's only making me want to cut my hair even more. I wonder if I could cut it myself? Or would I mess it up... It'll grow anyway, so it shouldn't be that big of a problem? I'm also a bit scared to go to a salon because your expectation is so different from reality (haha). It's a specific style, and I haven't seen a lot of salons do that style? Or maybe I just don't go to salons as much. Eitherway, I'm just being cautious. 

I've also been feeling a bit sick lately. I'm not sure why that is, but I hope I can heal quickly since I've got a lot to do. I don't like feeling sick.  </p>

<summary> 12.13.25 - <i>Bonding with Friends/Family.</i></summary>
  <p> I played badminton with some friends today and it was quite fun! It's been a while since I've played but it reminded me of how much fun sports can be - I should probably exercise more because I get tired real quick. Anyway, I went home immediately and watched some shows with my family. First, it was a few episodes of "Physical 100:Asia", then we switched to "The Good Place". </p>

<summary> 12.6.25 - <i>Unlucky... </i> </summary>
  <p> I've been so hapless these past few days... I’m honestly a bit pissed and anxious right now. I’m wondering where my ID even went. Worst-case scenario is that I lost it the previous day while going home and it disappeared, or someone might have taken it. I really hope that if someone found it or picked it up, please. It should have my contact info on the ID, right? I’m really worried.  Oh, and it's not just one... BUT TWO IDs. It’d be such a hassle to replace things, especially if it ends up being found anyway. I’m going to pray really hard that I’ll find it and that it gets returned to me. I swear I already searched the house, but it’s really not here.

But this isn’t even my biggest worry, because dang, I also don’t have my consent form. Where did I even put it? Or I don’t even know where I put it. Didn’t I get a lot of copies? I honestly don’t know, it feels like it’s gone. I’ll probably have to get it printed again. I know I can get it notarized again... But it’s already needed tomorrow, so that’s super stressful.

I’m so forgetful. I’ve been so out of it these past few days, I don’t even know what’s going on. Ughhhh. I don’t know anymore. I just want to scream. I hope everything turns out okay. I mean, it will be okay, but still. I need my ID so badly. I hate thinking about lost things. If it were just a pen or something, that’d be fine, but losing something this important is just awful. I’m so anxious about it. It’ll be fine eventually. But I’ll have to find a way to get it back. </p>

<summary> 12.3.25 - <i>Getting carried away. </i></summary>
  <p> I don't really notice it that often, but I guess I can become quite ambitious and competitive. I tend to idealize a LOT. When it comes to projects, I may or may not underestimate the effort and resources needed to achieve the specific vision I have... So I may tend to go ovver board when I have ideas running through my head. With the website, I've been indecisive with the design because I want it to look good. I enjoy making things like this, so I want to do well - I'll consider it as practice. I ended up making a whole layout, which I COMPLETED, but ended up scrapping because I was inspired by another aesthetic or whatever. I think I just need to shut my brain off and continue my pursuits. One thing I struggle with is trusting the process. If I don't immediately know what the outcome will be, then I have a hard time trusting the process and following through with it - Hence, I tend to change things up, even last minute. It's a struggle because I'll end up regretting it (if under a deadline), but I make it work somehow. This should be a lesson for me to keep things going rather than letting perfectionism take over. </p>

<summary> 11.27.25 - <i>Keeping busy. </i> </summary>
  <p> I like being busy. I think the reason I want to "do everything," immerse myself in random hobbies and take summer classes because I simply don't like staying put. I feel aimless and unproductive. Even during school days, I feel lazy during my free time because I never really know what to do. I could do anything, but I end up going on my phone which is super unproductive. I don't have to always be productive, but I guess I prefer it that way? I like being busy, by my own pace. I sometimes get overwhelmed when there's too much to do, but I think those are the times I actually start planning my days—I end up starting things instead of waiting last minute. I literally downloaded notion just to organize everything. I really need structure. I think it sucks not having things to do? I'm just not used to winging things. I mean, I should learn to, but maybe not like this? I think this benefits me more 😭. Even when it comes to my work, it's very messy—I take longer to finish things, and I don't like splitting them in parts. That's a fault... I need to learn to break things down just so I could do multiple things in a day. Anyway, I really want to do something else. </p>
